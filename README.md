The Fashion MNIST dataset for the same. This dataset comprises of images corresponding to ten classes: T-shirt/top, Trouser, Pullover, Dress, Coat, Sandal, Shirt, Sneaker, Bag, and Ankle boot.
1.In this first case, we will build a neural network with one hidden layer having one neuron and with the absence of a non-linear activation function . At this point do not worry about the details of the code, just concentrate on the outcome.

2.Build a network with one hidden layer having ten neurons
3.In the previous two cases, our models were performing linear regression due to the linear activation function.introduce non-linearity to the above case to make it a classification model.
4. Increase the number of hidden layers.Three hidden layers, each with ten neurons and lastly accompanied by a non-linear activation function.
6.At last we can observe, there is a slight improvement in the validation accuracy, 84.54%. We can build an optimum network by tuning each hyperparameter.
